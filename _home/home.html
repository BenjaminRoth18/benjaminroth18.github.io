                Nearly 20 years ago, I started my journey in software development, creating everything from small websites to enterprise cloud solutions.

                Over time, I've specialized in building cloud-based web applications, microservice architectures, and frontends using ReactJS and Angular, delivering user-friendly, scalable, and maintainable solutions.

                But at the end of the day, I'm always interested in cycling through the bavarian alps, having a good windsurfing session, or playing the guitar. I like loud rock music, the southern california sun is one of my favorite and the whole north of lake garda is where I spend my summers.

                I graduated in Mediadesign in early 2007 and I`m proud to combine this passion with my job. With a decade of experience, IÂ´ve worked with startups, agencies and software companies.

                I am currently working as a Frontend Engineer. I have a passion for outstanding ideas, small details and well implemented projects. Inspire people is one of my most important goals as well as the fact to make every project to my best work to date.

                But at the end of the day I`m always interested in playing guitar or having a good windsurf session. I like rock music and the california sun is one of my favorite, the whole north of lake garda is where I spend my summers and I support the FC Barcelona with all my heart.

                But at the end of the day, I'm always interested in cycling through the bavarian alps, having a good windsurfing session, or playing the guitar. I like rock music and the california sun is one of my favorite, the whole north of lake garda is where I spend my summers and I support the FC Barcelona with all my heart.
